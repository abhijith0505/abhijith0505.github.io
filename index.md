"Simple, yet sophisticated" - according to a colleague and a friend.

I read, ([a lot](https://abhijithc.com/blog/2023/05/01/i-started-reading-again.html)). Follow me on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159213582-abhijith-c), show me what you read too.

I travel, I had a dream come true by watching the [FIFA WC](https://blog.badpallod.com/my-trip-to-qatar-for-fifa-wc/) at Qatar. Yet to figure out how to tell people I travel.

I build machine learning systems at **[Glance](https://www.glance.com/)**. I function in a full-stack (ML) capacity. I build ML models, work on real-time & scalable systems, the infrastructure, and lead a team.

Currently working on Recommendation Systems in an online learning and online prediction environment, with a toe dipped into building edge ml capabilities. Not averse to software development (UI dev, perhaps). I can code.

Elsewhere, I am an [online Master's student at Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) specializing in machine learning.
