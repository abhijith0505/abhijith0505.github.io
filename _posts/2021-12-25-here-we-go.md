Like every other new year, I've planned to start something new this new year too, a Masters program from Georgia Tech. The real challenge is that I'll be doing this alongside my usual work. I work as a Data Scientist at Glance where I work on building real-time recommendation systems. Now you get why I called it a *real challenge*. 

I've been accepted into the online Master of Science program in CS ([OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/)) from Georgia Tech. Just to pile up more work on myself (why not, haha), I have decided to start a series of blogs where I shall share my learnings and experiences with OMSCS. I haven't completely thought this through. I am uncertain about what to write or whether I'll even have the time to do this. We'll know soon, won't we. In case I change my mind, I may or may not delete this post. I'll think about that later. 

Negativity aside, I'll try to champion the topic I learn in the courses. Being one of the most famous online Master's program, you can find plenty of course related information, tips, tricks and what not on the internet. So, I'll avoid the redundancy and focus on what I learn.
