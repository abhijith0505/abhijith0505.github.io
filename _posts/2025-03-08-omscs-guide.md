## **Why Choose OMSCS?**

### **Key Advantages**

1. **Affordability** – Approximately **\$7,000 in total tuition**, significantly less than comparable on-campus programs (\~\$50K+).
2. **Prestige** – Ranked among the **top 10 CS programs globally**, with world-class faculty.
3. **Equivalent Credential** – The degree is identical to that of on-campus students and does not indicate "online."
4. **Flexible Scheduling** – Designed for working professionals, allowing students to tailor their pace.
5. **Diverse Specializations** – Options include **Machine Learning, Computing Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics**.
6. **Industry Recognition** – GT alumni are well-regarded in leading technology companies worldwide.

### **Is OMSCS Worth It?**

Absolutely. OMSCS is highly respected in the industry, with companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta valuing graduates for their ability to balance full-time work with intensive coursework, demonstrating strong time management and technical skills. Many graduates have successfully transitioned into senior technical roles, research positions, or specialized domains such as machine learning and cybersecurity. For roles that require a master’s degree, this credential provides access to those opportunities without the financial and logistical constraints of a traditional on-campus program.

> "My recent change in job, where I moved to an organisation at a Lead level, was easier due to the Master's credential from GT."

## **Admissions Process & Requirements**

### **How Competitive Is Admission?**

Unlike many other top-tier CS programs, OMSCS has a **high acceptance rate**, provided applicants submit a **strong Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letters of Recommendation (LORs).**

### **OMSCS Admission Criteria**

- **Bachelor’s degree in CS or a related field** (Applicants from non-CS backgrounds can apply with relevant experience).
- **GPA** – No strict cutoff, but **3.0+ is preferable**.
- **English Proficiency** – **TOEFL or IELTS** (for non-native English speakers).
- **SOP & LORs** – Must demonstrate technical competency and ability to manage work and studies.
- **GRE is not required.**

> "TOEFL with a 100+ score is good."

### **Tips for SOP & LORs**

- **SOP** – Highlight **technical expertise, project experience, and motivation** for pursuing OMSCS. The requirement is no longer a SOP, I believe. It would be a form with multiple questions to fill in, but the contents of these put together would somewhat mirror an SOP.
- **LORs** – Ideally, secure one from an **academic professor (preferably PhD) and two from a senior professional (Director/VP-level).**

> "My acceptance was based on a mid-tier SOP and LORs from my workplace. OMSCS has a lower admissions barrier than other elite CS programs."

### **Application Deadlines**

- **Spring intake** – Apply by **August**
- **Fall intake** – Apply by **March**
- **No first-come, first-served policy** – Applications are reviewed collectively after the deadline.

### **Transcripts & GPA Calculation**

- If your undergraduate institution uses a **percentage-based grading system**, convert it to **GPA (4.0 scale)** using an **online GPA calculator**.
- GT provides a **paid GPA conversion service**, but self-reporting is often sufficient.

> "I did not use a paid service. Instead, I listed my percentage and noted that my university did not follow a GPA system. I used an online calculator to provide an approximate GPA conversion.
>
> However, I recommend verifying the latest requirements, as the process may have changed in recent years."

## **TOEFL vs. IELTS – Which One to Take?**

- **TOEFL is straightforward** – **A week of preparation is usually enough**.
- **IELTS is another option**, but TOEFL is more commonly recommended.
- **It is advisable to watch YouTube tutorials and take one or two mock tests** to familiarize yourself with the test format.

## **Coursework & Workload Expectations**

### **How Challenging Is OMSCS?**

- **This is not a casual online program** – The coursework matches **on-campus rigor**.
- Expect **10-15 hours per week for easier courses** and **20-25 hours per week for more demanding ones**.
- Courses include **weekly assignments, projects, and exams**.
- **Submission deadlines are often Sundays**, so planning ahead is essential.

> "OMSCS is demanding. You will need to manage your time effectively, especially during midterms and final exams."
>
> "I balanced OMSCS with a full-time job and personal commitments. It was challenging, but with proper time management, I was able to complete the program successfully and still have fun and go on vacations."

### **How Many Courses Should You Take Per Semester?**

- **First semester** – Start with **one course** to acclimate to the program.
- Subsequent semesters – **Pair one challenging course with one easier course.**
- **Avoid enrolling in two difficult courses simultaneously**, as the workload will be overwhelming.

### **OMSCS Course Structure**
